# Iterations
Develop an algorithm for a Java program that randomly picks a whole number between 1 and 100 inclusive. It should then ask the user to guess
the number. In response to the guess, have the program respond “Too High”, “Too Low” or “That’s Right”.
If the guess is right, the program should end. Otherwise, the program should allow the user to make another guess and continue on until they get it right. A user should be able to abort the
program by entering a negative number.
At the end, tell the user how many guesses they made before finding the correct number – but only if they are successful.
Finally, if the user guesses correctly OR aborts, they should be given the opportunity to start over with a new number.
